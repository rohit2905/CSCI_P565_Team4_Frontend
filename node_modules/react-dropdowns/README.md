# react-dropdowns

Inspired by [Bootstrap's 3.x dropdowns component](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#dropdowns), `react-dropdowns` is a
React component that allows you dropdown menus similar to Bootstrap's.

## Installation

The easiest way to use `react-dropdowns` is to install it from NPM and include it in your React build process (using [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), etc).

```bash
npm install react-dropdowns --save
```

You can also use the standalone build by including `dist/react-dropdowns.js` and `dist/react-dropdowns.css` in your page. If you do this, make sure you already included the following dependencies:

* [ClickedAwayMixin](https://github.com/dennisduong/react-addons-clicked-away-mixin)
* [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [classNames](http://jedwatson.github.io/classnames/)

## Usage

Take a look at the the examples in the Examples section; they should give a good impression of what `ReactDropdowns` can do, and the source code of the examples is probably the fastest way to learn how to use `ReactDropdowns`.

## CSS stylesheet

I've built a default stylesheet, `dist/react-dropdowns.css`, that you may include in your sites/projects. 

You can customize the styles by modifying the stylesheet itself or by using [less](http://lesscss.org/) and modifying the less files in the `/less` directory.
